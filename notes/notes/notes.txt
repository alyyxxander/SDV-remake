Instead of the game camera following the player, we have it set up
so that: 
	the game camera will follow the camera object, 
	and the camera object will follow the player


press the "B" key to show the bounding boxes
press the "C" key and use the arrow keys to move the camera around




top left corner is cutoff when using sprites for tiles!!!
	craftables sprite needs fixed bc of this
