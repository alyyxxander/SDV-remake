Instead of the game camera following the player, we have it set up so that: 
	the game camera will follow the camera object, 
	and the camera object will follow the player

press the "O" key to toggle debug mode
press and hold the "C" key and use the arrow keys to move the camera around
press the "P" key to toggle planting mode

top left corner is cutoff when using sprites for tiles!!!
	craftables sprite needs fixed bc of this


since we made obj_collision a parent of obj_parent_NPC, all of the 
NPCs are collision objects!
