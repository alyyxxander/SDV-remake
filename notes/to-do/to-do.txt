[ ] finish farm map
	[ ] add ponds
	[ ] fix grass and decorative details

[ ] top left corner is cutoff when using sprites for tiles!!!
	craftables sprite needs fixed bc of this

[ ] fix the weird blur when moving

[x] on obj_crop -> create event:
	find a fix that allows maxGrowthStage to vary for different crop types

[ ] fix the days it takes to grow isssue -- havinnng to press the "G" button 
	like 50 times for something to grow
	
	
	
in the create_crop_type.gml script, the line: var growth_stage_duration = total_days_to_grow div max_growth_stage;
can cause crops to appearfully grown beforee htey actually are
example: 
	green beans take 10 days to grow
		var growth_stage_duration = total_days_to_grow div max_growth_stage;
	will be equivalent to:
		var growth_stage_duration = 10 div 7;
	which will give a result of 1 due to "div" rounding, meaning each growth 
	stage will take 1 day to grow
